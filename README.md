For an in-depth documentation and tutorials, please see https://alethio.gitbook.io/memento/

--- 

Memento is a tool developed by Alethio to scrape and index data from any web3-compatible networks.

The main goal of the tool is to scrape the raw data from the network, do the necessary transformations and insert it into an indexed database from which it is exposed through the integrated API.

Seamless integration with the [Ethereum Lite Explorer by Alethio](https://github.com/Alethio/ethereum-lite-explorer) provides you the full blockchain exploration capabilities without the need of a third party.

Easily check the system status, perform various actions and manage your configuration through the built-in dashboard.
